Visualization of obtained TCR CDR3a amino acid sequences. For this demonstration there are 3 donors across 2 tissues (blood vs. lung) such that all 3 donors have known pulmonary Mtb infections.

The biological question: Are specific TCR sequences, specifically pertaining to MAIT cells, enriched in the lung of individuals with a tuberculosis infection?

Results: Although larger data sets with appropriate controls are needed for cross-cohort statistical comparisons, we observe a trend that supports the hypothesis that certain MAIT TCR are enriched in the lung of the donors.
